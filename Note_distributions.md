### 4. Poisson Experiment
A Poisson experiment is a statistical experiment that has the following properties:

- The outcome of each trial is either success or failure.
- The average number of successes (lambda) that occurs in a specified region is known.
- The probability that a success will occur is proportional to the size of the region.
- The probability that a success will occur in an extremely small region is virtually zero.

### 5. Normal Distribution

PDF: probability in continuous random var x, 
PMF: probability in discreate random var x, P(X=x)
CDF: cumulative probability in discreate random var x from negative infinity to P(X<=x)

### 6. Central Limit Theorem

***Central limit theorem(CLT)*** refer to sample mean follows normal distribution with a large N.
- Sample mean ~ N(mu,std/sqrt(n)), where ***mu=pop/sample mean*** and ***std=(sample mean)/sqrt(n)***
- Sum of sample mean ~ N(mu',std'), where ***mu' = n\*mu_sample*** and ***std' = sqrt(n)\*std_sample***
