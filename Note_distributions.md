### 4. Poisson Experiment
A Poisson experiment is a statistical experiment that has the following properties:

- The outcome of each trial is either success or failure.
- The average number of successes (lambda) that occurs in a specified region is known.
- The probability that a success will occur is proportional to the size of the region.
- The probability that a success will occur in an extremely small region is virtually zero.
