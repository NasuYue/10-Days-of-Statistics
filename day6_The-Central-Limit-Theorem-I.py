# Task
# A large elevator can transport a maximum of 9800 pounds. Suppose a load of cargo containing 49 boxes must be transported via the elevator. The box weight of this type of cargo follows a distribution with a mean of mu=205 pounds and a standard deviation of sigma=15 pounds. Based on this information, what is the probability that all 49 boxes can be safely loaded into the freight elevator and transported?

# Central limit theorem(CLT) refer to sample mean follows normal distribution with a large N.
# sample sum follows Norm(mu',std') 
# mu' = n*mu; std' = sqrt(n)*sigma,
